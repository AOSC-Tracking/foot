Please search the man page (`foot.ini(5)` and `foot(1)`); maybe the
feature already exists?

If the feature does not exist in your installed version of foot,
please check the **latest** version of foot; maybe the feature has
already been added?

Please describe your feature request in as much details as
possible. Describe your use case. Explain why the existing feature set
is not sufficient. Foot is (trying to be) a minimalistic terminal
emulator; explain how your desired feature does not add bloat.
